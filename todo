- [done] change use to set next not already set object of given type
- [done] add replace(int, object) to replace already set object at given position
- [done] use boost::preprocessor or your own macros to generate multiple factories
- add support for parametrized constructors in factories
- add error handling (exceptions) and static_asserts
- synchronization (the same factory producing at once on different threads)
- make it possible to use inject<Type> instead of inject<Type,Class> (will be probably less efficient in multi-threading env)
- is builder possible?
