- [done] change use to set next not already set object of given type
- [done] add replace(int, object) to replace already set object at given position
- [done] use boost::preprocessor or your own macros to generate multiple factories
- [rejected] add support for parametrized constructors in factories
- [done] add error handling (exceptions) and static_asserts
- [done] synchronization (the same factory producing at once on different threads)
- [not applicable] replace template<T> use() with preprocessor generated use() methods, that wouldn't need to use for_each and allow polymorphic builders
- [done] make it possible to use inject<Type> instead of inject<Type,Class> (will be probably less efficient in multi-threading env)
- [done] add delegation
- create assembly object, from which builders could be created
- make it possible to define layers, and determine access rights between them
- create modules which could belong to layers and be parts of assembly

module.use();
